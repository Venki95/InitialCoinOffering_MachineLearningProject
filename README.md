Initial Coin Offers(ICOs) are a new way for startups to raise funding.
  1. Import Data set and Import Libraries are Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib.
  2. Data Cleaning and Handling Missing Data.
  3. Performed Encoding Categorial Data using Label Encoder method.
  4. Applied all classification models to predict which startup is succeeding through an Initial coin offer (ICO).
  5. Data Visualization is done to get proper insights from the data.
  6. Build and Trained the model using Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and Naive Bayes Algorithm.
  7. Predicted startup succeeded with 74% accuracy on Random Forest Algorithm.
